## Concepts 

__Unit test__ is test code which proving whether the source code is excuted as intended or not.

In other words, Unit test is writing __test case__ for each methods.

Thanks to unit test, developer can find out bugs fast, and it can be solved.

Then what is the relation between Unit test and __Mock__?

As you know, All test casses should be seperated.  Generating Mock object is a good way to make it.

## How to make Unit test in Xcode
For proceeding unit test, generate test target first, and then make connection between current project and unit test.


There are two ways to make unit test.

### Include unit test When the project is generating. 

When you generate project, `Include Unit Tests` is one of the option.

It automatically generates Unit tests in project.


### Include unit test after generating project.


If you create a project without selecting any items, you can create and include test code in the following ways.
You can add it to the sixth item from the left of the Navigator first and then press the + button at the bottom.


If you create a unit test target, you need to select the project you want to test in the Target to be Tested section as follows. This is not the end, but you must finally include the test target as target membership in the files of the project under test. This is because the test target can access the module under test.

## Life cycle of unit test


After generating test target, test class would be generated like as below. these methods are excuted by order. 

Before explaining ordering of methods, I will let you know the role of each methods

```swift
class SetUpAndTearDownExampleTestCase: XCTestCase {
    
    override class func setUp() { // 1.
        super.setUp()
        // This is the setUp() class method.
        // It is called before the first test method begins.
        // Set up any overall initial state here.
    }
    
    override func setUp() { // 2.
        super.setUp()
        // This is the setUp() instance method.
        // It is called before each test method begins.
        // Set up any per-test state here.
    }
    
    func testMethod1() { // 3.
        // This is the first test method.
        // Your testing code goes here.
        addTeardownBlock { // 4.
            // Called when testMethod1() ends.
        }
    }
    
    func testMethod2() { // 5.
        // This is the second test method.
        // Your testing code goes here.
        addTeardownBlock { // 6.
            // Called when testMethod2() ends.
        }
        addTeardownBlock { // 7.
            // Called when testMethod2() ends.
        }
    }
    
    override func tearDown() { // 8.
        // This is the tearDown() instance method.
        // It is called after each test method completes.
        // Perform any per-test cleanup here.
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
    override class func tearDown() { // 9.
        // This is the tearDown() class method.
        // It is called after all test methods complete.
        // Perform any overall cleanup here.
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
}
```



### setUp()
Provides an opportunity to reset state before each test method in a test case is called.

__When `setUp()` is useful?__

We can generate new instance for variable.
It is same meaning with initiating from class.


### tearDown()

Provides an opportunity to perform cleanup after each test method in a test case ends

__When `tearDown()` is useful?__

We allocated some data from `setUp()` function. 
Some of things should be deallocated.

Transaction callback, file closing, removing element in list.


Both `setUp()` and `tearDown()` is called only once.


### testMethod 1, 2 

Set test cases which you want to test.
If you use `XCTAssert()` method here, it supports whether it is true or not.


Simply now, we know the role of methods. I think you could predict the ordering like as below.

## Test Example 

At first, difficult things about unit test is not about concepts but finding the way how to use.
Therefore, let us know the step of unit test by example.
 
I proceeded person example. This example should  check whether each person is student or not. If the age of person is lower than 20, that person is student.

Here is struct of person.

```swift
struct Person {
    let personName: String
    let age: Int
    var isStudent: Bool { get{
        return age < 20
        }}
}
```

We can define `isStudent()` methods for each person now. I checked Liam and Ella.
Initiate each person and use `XCTAssert()` method to check whether `isStudent` is True or not.
   
Because they are students, it returns true and show u green square signal.


<img src="/images/unittest/unittest4.png" width="600" height="400">

As you can see, red square signal is shown when the condition of `isStudent` method is not true.


## Conclusion
Unit test is useful to serperate and manage test code from source code. It is good to find strategy which code should be tested.

Mocking and Stubing make it easier,so following posting will be about these thing.

Hope this post is helpful to you.
