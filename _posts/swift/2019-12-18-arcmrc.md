We have heard many times about memory leak issues, but it is hard to understand 100%. 

Usually in swift, retain cycles occur memory leak often. Therefore, understading ARC and retain cycles will show the way how to manage memory.



__ARC__ is abbreviation of Automatic Reference Counting, and __MRC__ is abbreviation of Manual Refetence Counting.

Okay then, What is the __'Reference Counting'__?

This is the reason what makes me difficult to understand this concept at first.

Object internally stores reference count.

<img src="/images/arc/arc1.png" width="400" height="120">

If the object is referenced by variable, then we increase +1 reference count.

## ARC

From the above  __'Reference Counting' __  
explaination, you could predict what ARC is.

Easily say, Object automatically deinitailize after reference removed.

In detail, when the reference is removed by variable, Reference count of object automatically will be -1 decreased.

If reference count is zero, then the object automatically would be deitialized as well.

<img src="/images/arc/arc2.png" width="400" height="120">

Swift supports ARC, so we don't need to manually count the number of object reference.

This can be known by code.

```swift
class FruitClass {
    init() {
        print("init")
    }
    
    deinit{
        print("deinit")
    }
}

var fruitClass : FruitClass? = FruitClass()
fruitClass = nil
```
I use fruit example as usual, it does not have any meaning about fruit.

Because ARC supports automatic denitializing, you can see the result as below.

```swift
init
deinit
```

## MRC

I will not explain it much, but you can imagine it does not support automatic reference count.

When we used obj-c, we should count reference manually.

You should __manually make and count reference__ on obj-c by using __alloc, new, cioy, mutalbeCopy, retain.. etc.__

Because swift supports ARC, We do not need to code with MRC, but it is good to know the concepts above to understand ARC well.



## Retain Cycle

Since ARC supports everything, it looks like we do not need to care about memory management.

However, there is a exeption to deal with.
Yes, It is __retain cycle.__

Some cases like delegate pattern, we should pair two object as reference.

<img src="/images/arc/arc4.png" width="400" height="320">

At first in this example, each instance object has 2 references.

If both fruitClass1 and fruitClass2 remove their reference about instance object,

<img src="/images/arc/arc3.png" width="400" height="320">

Each object remain 1 reference count after removed reference by variable.



In this case, Objects are remained in memory.


```swift


class FruitRetainClass{
    var fruitRetainClass: FruitRetainClass? = nil
    init(){
        print("init")
    }
    deinit{
        print("deinit")
    }
}

var fruitRetainClass1: FruitRetainClass? = FruitRetainClass()
var fruitRetainClass2: FruitRetainClass? = FruitRetainClass()

fruitRetainClass1?.fruitRetainClass = fruitRetainClass2
fruitRetainClass2?.fruitRetainClass = fruitRetainClass1

fruitRetainClass1 = nil
fruitRetainClass2 = nil
```
This can be checked by code as well.

The result is

```swift
init
init
```

We cannot see the result of deinit.

## Weak

Reference which we used until now, is __strong reference__.
__strong reference__ references object and counts reference count.

However we need additional reference system for solving retain cycles issue.
Yes, It is __weak reference__.

__Weak reference__ references object, but it does not count reference count.

Okay, then how can __weak reference__ solve retain cycles issue?

As I explained, if the reference count of object is zero in ARC, and then the object is automatically deinitailized. 

You can predict the result of retain cycles based on above fact.


Because weak reference never counted, FruitClass1 instance and FruitClass2 instance's reference count is originally 1.

 
<img src="/images/arc/arc6.png" width="400" height="320">

After instance object reference is removed  by fruitClass1 and fruitClass2, both FruitClass1 instance object and FruitClass2 instance object's reference count is zero.

<img src="/images/arc/arc5.png" width="400" height="320">

As a result, objects are deititailized.


As same way, you can also prevent retain cycles by __only making a reference as weak.__ 

This result can be shown by code example.

FruitRetainClass1 bind to FruitRetainClass2 as weak, and FruitRetainClass2 bind to FruitRetainClass1 as strong below.

```swift
class FruitRetainClass1{
    weak var fruitRetainClass: FruitRetainClass2? = nil
    init(){
        print("init")
    }
    deinit{
        print("deinit")
    }
}

class FruitRetainClass2{
    var fruitRetainClass: FruitRetainClass1? = nil
    init(){
        print("init")
    }
    deinit{
        print("deinit")
    }
}

var fruitRetainClass1: FruitRetainClass1? = FruitRetainClass1()
var fruitRetainClass2: FruitRetainClass2? = FruitRetainClass2()

fruitRetainClass1?.fruitRetainClass = fruitRetainClass2
fruitRetainClass2?.fruitRetainClass = fruitRetainClass1

fruitRetainClass1 = nil
fruitRetainClass2 = nil
```
the result is 

```swift
init
init
deinit
deinit
```


Therefore, making __'weak'__ the reference of retain cycle, makes problem solved.

## Unowned


It has same function as weak, but additionally it can not be nil.
This means you can use unowned only if it does not access removed memory space.

Usually, Unowned is not recommanded.


## Conclusion

I have searched many times about ARC, but It is difficult to fully understand.

I feel like, "Okay, automatically count reference.. so what?" until understanding with these picture.

Drawing the image of reference relations would be help you to understand concepts well.
