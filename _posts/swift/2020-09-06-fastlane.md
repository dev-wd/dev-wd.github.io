There are many things to consider for __reducing deployment time__.

__Fastlane__ is useful for resolving the issuse. 

__Fastlane__ is Ruby based automatic build opensource library.

For your iOS project, they support code signing, screenshot for app store connect, uploading testflight, uploading app store automatically.


I will just explain and work for full process of __automatic uploading testflight__.



### Install fastlane

On your commandline,  type the line like as below.


```
# Use RubyGems 
sudo gem install fastlane -NV 

# Use Homebrew  
brew cask install fastlane

```

### Fastlane initial setting for your project

This is the process to generate lanes at first.

Type __`fastlane init`__ on your commantline.

You can see the results.

```

For now, I will upload my app to testflight. 

Choosed number 2.

Then, Fastlane asks Apple ID for accessing App Store Connect.

Enter your apple ID which is registered on App Store Connect.

[18:56:39]: 
[18:56:39]: - Create and manage your provisioning profiles on the Developer Portal
[18:56:39]: - Upload and manage TestFlight and App Store builds on App Store Connect
[18:56:39]: - Manage your App Store Connect app metadata and screenshots
[18:56:39]: 
[18:56:39]: Your Apple ID credentials will only be stored in your Keychain, on your local machine

```

It is the whole process for initializing fastlane folder at first.

From now on, you can upload your app to testflight by typing a command line __`fastlane beta`__!  

### Understanding lane

__`Fastline init`__ makes your app to upload testflight & appstore easy.

However, what if you want to custom own command?

Fastlane supports __`lane`__ for custom command excuting units.

These are defined on `fastfile` in fastlane folder



- `Appfile`: Restore app identifier, Apple ID.
- `Fastfile`: Manages lanes for asking specific actions.

```
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Push a new beta build to TestFlight"
  lane :beta do
    increment_build_number(xcodeproj: "GitToday.xcodeproj")
    build_app(workspace: "GitToday.xcworkspace", scheme: "GitToday")
    upload_to_testflight
  end
end

```

`platform` shows you what platform do this command supports.

In iOS platform, there could be many lanes.

Above code is the lane produced from `Fastlane init`
It is serial units for `fastlane beta`.
 

Each `lane` is each fastlane commands.



### Add Options for lane.

You can pass parameters from the command line to your lane.

From __fastlane docs__ , use the following syntax.

```
fastlane [lane] key:value key2:value2

fastlane deploy submit:false build_number:24
```

and you can also excute command of lane in lane like as following definition.

```
lane :deploy do |options|
  # ...
  build(release: true) # that's the important bit
  hockey
  # ...
end


lane :build do |options|
  scheme = (options[:release] ? "Release" : "Staging")
  build_ios_app(scheme: scheme)
end
```

These Options what I introduced are very useful.
Also, there are many other options for customizing your lanes. 

If you want to know more options, check from [fastlane docs](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/lanes/)
