It is the post which I studied for high coverage of test code in company.


## Why do we need TestCode?

Before knowing how to test RxSwift based code, I wonder the reason why should we write test code.


- Good for maintainance
- predefined requirement which make intended programming posiible
- Because we have test code, Do not need to consider side effect error when we refactor codes.

These are the advantages of test code which I agreed from others posting.

Therefore, We can __code intented as requirement, and don't need to worry about error from refactoring__ 😆

It is hard to write test code at first, but it gives more advantage for a long time.

Personally, I used to write code with RxSwift, I wonder `How do I test RxSwift based code?`.

The answer is __`Test the code whether Observable comes in to Observer as we want!`__



## TestCode in RxSwift

For testing RxSwift code, I will explain the concept of __RxTest and RxBlocking__, and then, show you the example of them for understanding.

This posting is for knowing basic usage of Testing RxSwift, not for adapting RxTest to project.


For overall, the difference between  __RxTest and  RxBlocking__ is like below.

|Defference|RxBlocking| RxTest|
|:--------|:--------:|--------:|
| __Observable__ | Cold | <center>Hot & Cold</center> |
| __Time tracking__ | No | <center>Yes</center> |

In summary, __RxBlocking__ is for cold observable which could emits `onComplete`, and it cannot detect the emitting time of events as well.

However, __RxTest__ can be used in Hot Observables where the stream does not break without `onComplete`, and it is also possible to check whether the Observable has arrived at the desired timing.

You don't need to understand all yet, I will explain the detail with example below.☺️

## RxBlocking


__RxBlocking__ converts the previously received events into an array when the Observer receives the `onComplete` event from the Observable.

That's why it cannot be used in hot observables where `onComplete` does not come in.

Let's look at this with the code.

```Swift
func testOfRxBlocking() {
	let observable = Observable.from(["apple", "orange", "banana"]).toBlocking()
	let fruits = try! observable.Array()
	XCTAssertEqual(fruits, ["apple", "orange", "banana"])
}
```
As you can see, there are `toBlocking()` and `.Array()`  for all to understand __RxBlocking__.


- __toBlocking()__ : Observable -> BlockingObservable

- __Array()__: BlockingObservable -> Array

__BlockingObservable__ which is made by `toBlocking`  makes the emitted events to be an Array.


### RxTimeInterval


If you put the timeout factor, you can also receive events up to the time you want.

```swift
toBlocking(timeout: RxTimeInterval?)
```

이런 경우에만 예외적으로 RxBlocking에서 Hot Observable도 적용 가능합니다.


## RxTest

__RxTest__ creates a test scheduler, and then creates __observers and observables__ within the test scheduler.

`.next()`에 입력 시간, event 내 value를 동시에 넣어줌으로써 TestScheduler의 initialClock으로 부터 개발자가 지정한 입력시간이 되었을 때에 event를 observer에 방출하게 됩니다. 
 
 By input the time and value in event `.next()` at the same time, when the input time is specified by the developer, the event is emitted to the observer.
 
 Let's see the below for understanding :)

```Swift
func testOfRxTest() {
	let scheduler = TestScheduler(initialClock: 0)
	let bag = DisposeBag()
	
	let observable = scheduler.createHotObservable([
		.next(1, "apple"),
		.next(2, "orange"),
		.next(3, "banana")
	])
	
	let observer = scheduler.createObserver(String.self)
	observable.subscribe(observer).disposed(by: bag)
	
	scheduler.start()
	
	XCTAssertEqual(observer.events, [
		.next(1, "apple"),
		.next(2, "orange"),
		.next(3, "banana")
	])
}
```

The order is , 

__1.__ Create TestScheduler.

__2.__ Define observable and obserber from TestScheduler 

__3.__ Running Test Scheduler through `.start ()`

__4.__ Check if observer.events came in the same value as sent

Additionally, Scheduler runs until the last time given in `.next ()`. Forthermore, `onComplete` comes in, it continues until` onComplete` comes in.



As a result, we can test both Hot Observable and Cold Observable!

 
## Conclusion
 
It is difficult at first, but for good maintainance of our projet, why don't you adapt RxTest on your project?
