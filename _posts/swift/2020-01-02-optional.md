In Swift, variable must have value. Because swift wants to ensure safety from run-time error, swift do not allow NULL in variable.

Alternatively, to deal the situation of NULL, swift supports __Optional Type__.

## Optional Type
__"Optional"__  is the expression which can not have value, or have value.

Optional is expressed as __`Optional<Type>`__ and it can be shorten as __`?`__

So, usually we use `?`. Below is the example using optional variable.


```swift
var fruit: String? = "apple"
print(fruit)

fruit = nil
print(fruit)
```
Here is the result.

```
Optional("apple")
nil
```

It took long time to fully understand whole concepts. I explained it below.

It is easy to understand if you understand __`optional type`__ as a box. 
Now, we will input or output the value from the box.

<img src="/images/optional/op1.png" width="600" height="280">

image description. 

we call it __`Optional wrapping`__

If you input nil, then the box remained empty.

<img src="/images/optional/op2.png" width="600" height="280">

Of course we can abstract apple and nil from boxes, which is called __`Optional unwrapping`__

if you output from the empty box, then it gives nil.

So, it should be checked if the value is exist or nil before unwrapping optional. 

```swift
var fruit: String? = "apple"
if let fruitVal = fruit {
    print("Fruit is \(fruitVal)")
} else {
    print("Fruit is nil")
}
```

__`Optional unwrapping`__ is able only if nil type is checked, but we also can forcing unwrap without that process like as below.

<img src="/images/optional/op3.png" width="600" height="280">

If we use __`!`__ after variable, then we can get out of the value from box forcefully.


Overally, I explained the concept with box images. I hope you understand the concept.

We studied optional concepts until now, then how do we abstract value from that box?

There are serveral ways to abstract value from box(unwrapping optional).

## Serveral ways to unwrap optional

Indeed, I introduced  __`Optional Binding`__ and __`Forced Unwrapping`__ a little. However, I should deep dive into their details and other ways ass well.

### Optional Binding

This code is __`Optional Binding`__ which assigns the value from optional variable to other variable.

If fruit is nil, then it excutes else statement.

We call it optional binding because value is binded only if the value is not nil.


```swift
var fruit: String? = "apple"
if let fruitVal = fruit {
    print("Fruit is \(fruitVal)")
} else {
    print("Fruit is nil")
}
```

### Optional Chaining

For explaination, I referenced the code from yagom's blog

What if we should check multiple optional type?

From the code below, we should make many if statement for each type check.

It is not readable, so swift supports other function(Optional Chaining) for this case.

Optional Chaining is expressed as __`?.`__.
Because we chained optional type properties, Logic just need an if statement.


#### Example Class
```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    var job: String?
    var home: Apartment?
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

class Apartment {
    var buildingNumber: String
    var roomNumber: String
    var `guard`: Person?
    var owner: Person?
    
    init(dong: String, ho: String) {
        buildingNumber = dong
        roomNumber = ho
    }
}
```

#### Comparision between Optional Binding and Optional Chaining

```swift
let yagom: Person? = Person(name: "yagom")
let apart: Apartment? = Apartment(dong: "101", ho: "202")
let superman: Person? = Person(name: "superman")


// When using just Optional Binding
func guardJob(owner: Person?) {
    if let owner = owner {
        if let home = owner.home {
            if let `guard` = home.guard {
                if let guardJob = `guard`.job {
                    print("우리집 경비원의 직업은 \(guardJob)입니다")
                } else {
                    print("우리집 경비원은 직업이 없어요")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

guardJob(owner: yagom)

// When using Optional Chaining
func guardJobWithOptionalChaining(owner: Person?) {
    if let guardJob = owner?.home?.guard?.job {
        print("우리집 경비원의 직업은 \(guardJob)입니다")
    } else {
        print("우리집 경비원은 직업이 없어요")
    }
}

guardJobWithOptionalChaining(owner: yagom)
// 우리집 경비원은 직업이 없어요



yagom?.home?.guard?.job // nil

yagom?.home = apart

yagom?.home // Optional(Apartment)
yagom?.home?.guard // nil

yagom?.home?.guard = superman

yagom?.home?.guard // Optional(Person)

yagom?.home?.guard?.name // superman
yagom?.home?.guard?.job // nil

yagom?.home?.guard?.job = "경비원"
```

### Forced Unwrapping
As we see this by images, just get out of the value from the box without type check.
Because __`Forced Unwrapping`__ can occur runtime error, it is too dangerous.


Just adding __!__ after variable is so simple.

```swift
var fruit: String? = "apple"
print(fruit!)
```

But the problem is,

when optional has nil in box(own type), it occurs runtime error like below.

```swift
fruit = nil
print(fruit!)
```
Fatal error result.
```
Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value: file MyPlayground.playground, line 6
```
### Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals

When we think that Logic does not occur runtime error by nil, we use it.

By adding __`!`__ after the optional variable, we do not need to consider optional binding or forced unwrapping.


```swift 
var fruit: String! = "apple"
print(fruit)
fruit = nil
print(fruit)
```
This is results.

```
Optional("apple")
nil
```

Implicitly unwrapped optionals are convienient. However, because we can usually make mistake about nil, swift recommanded to use optional chaining and optional binding.

## Conclusion
Swift is the language wich is __safe, fast, expressive.__

Optional is one of the representative function which shows __Swifty__.

By checking NULL condition during compile time, we can persuing error safety.

Hope it helps you :)
