In Swift, __Grand Central Dispatch API (GCD)__ sopports thread programming.

Just using GCD is not difficult, but there are many preceding concepts to understand.


After understanding concepts, I arrange three types of gcd queues, and queues examples accordingly.

## Preceding concepts
### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
When the new thread is forked from original threa, we do the task parrallely.

__Synchoronous__ origin thread __wait__ until ending new thread. After new thread exit tasks, then origin thread get the return value of that thread, and continue the tasks.

__Asynchoronous__ origin thread __do not wait__ until the end of new thread. Therefore, Asynchoronous origin thread immediately get return value from new thread, and continue task.


### Serial vs Concurrent Queue

iOS supports either serial queue and concurrent queue GCD. 

__Serial queue__ is __FIFO__(First In, First Out), which usually called as queue in data structure concepts.

##### But then, what is concurrent queue?

Before knowing concurrent queue, we need to know 'concurrent' first.

It is easy to mistake that Concurrent is Parallelism.

When we do multi- threading, we can see threads are running parallely.

System memory resource is limitied and should be occupied by a thread, OS needs to switch thread which occupying OS memory resource continously. we call this situation as Concurrency.

Therefore, Relationship between parallelism and concurrency is like below.

__Parallelism requires concurrency, but concurrency does not guarantee parallelism.__

These are all concepts which included in GCD.

##  Three types of gcd queues
### Main queue
Main queue is queue running on the main thread of iOS, ans is serial queue.



### Global queues
Global queues are running on the many thread in whole iOS, and they are all concurrent queues.

Especially, Global queue supports specific properties which is called __Quality of Service (QoS)__.
QoS has __4 properties__ which decides priority on concurrent global queue.

#### QoS
__User - Interactive__
It is for UI task, and event handling which is short and must complete.
Running on main thread, even global queue.

__User-initiated__
It is for user request which requires immediate result whith ensuring non-block UI. 

__Utility__
Treat the task which takes long time.
It usually used for calculating, networking, I/O.


__Background__
The task which do not need for UI, and not that important as well.

and if you do not add any properties on glabal queue, this automatically set __'Default'__ QoS property.
 
This example shows how to insert qos property on global queue.

```swift 
// 1
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async { [weak self] in
  guard let self = self else {
    return
  }
  let overlayImage = self.faceOverlayImageFrom(self.image)

  // 2
  DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
    // 3
    self?.fadeInNewImage(overlayImage)
  }
}


```

### Coustom queues
Custom queues are created by user, it can be either serial and concurrent.


## Examples

Of course we read about the concepts about queues, but code examples can make us understand more easiler.

- Sync vs Async
- Serial vs Concurrent 



### Global Sync

this blog gave me insight to express example with fruit emoji.

- https://zeddios.tistory.com/516

Global Sync prints pear, and the other just prints apple.
 

```swift

DispatchQueue.global().sync {
    print("global start!=============")
    for i in 1...5 {
       print("🍊"+" \(i)ea")
    }
    print("global end!  =============")
}

for i in 1...5 {
    print("🍎"+" \(i)ea")
}


```

Because Global queue synchronously excuted, 
the next task will be procceed after global queue task.




```
global start!=============
🍊 1ea
🍊 2ea
🍊 3ea
🍊 4ea
🍊 5ea
global end!  =============
🍎 1ea
🍎 2ea
🍎 3ea
🍎 4ea
🍎 5ea

```


### Global Async

Global Async prints pear, and the other just prints apple.

```swift

DispatchQueue.global().async {
    print("global start!=============")
    for i in 1...5 {
       print("🍊"+" \(i)ea")
    }
    print("global end!  =============")
}

for i in 1...5 {
    print("🍎"+" \(i)ea")
}


```
Because Global queue asynchronously excuted, 
the next task excuted parallely.


```swift 
// 1 trial
global start!=============
🍎 1ea
🍊 1ea
🍎 2ea
🍎 3ea
🍊 2ea
🍎 4ea
🍎 5ea
🍊 3ea
🍊 4ea
🍊 5ea
global end!  =============

// 2 trial
global start!=============
🍎 1ea
🍊 1ea
🍎 2ea
🍊 2ea
🍎 3ea
🍊 3ea
🍎 4ea
🍎 5ea
🍊 4ea
🍊 5ea
global end!  =============


```
### Custom Serial Sync

Global Sync prints pear and peach, and the other just prints apple.



```swift 
let WDFruits = DispatchQueue(label: "WD")

WDFruits.sync {
    print("custom start!=============")

    for i in 1...5 {
        print("🍑"+" \(i)ea")

    }
    print("custom   end!=============")

}

WDFruits.sync {
    print("custom start!=============")

    for i in 1...5 {
        print("🍊"+" \(i)ea")

    }
    print("custom   end!=============")

}

for i in 1...5 {
    print("🍎"+" \(i)ea")
}

```

This example confused for me at first. 

In summary,

Serial makes custom queue run first before running main task. 

sync makes running peach first, rather than pear.


```
custom start!=============
🍑 1ea
🍑 2ea
🍑 3ea
🍑 4ea
🍑 5ea
custom   end!=============
custom start!=============
🍊 1ea
🍊 2ea
🍊 3ea
🍊 4ea
🍊 5ea
custom   end!=============
🍎 1ea
🍎 2ea
🍎 3ea
🍎 4ea
🍎 5ea
```

### Custom Serial Async 
Global Async prints pear and peach, and the other just prints apple.


```swift
let WDFruits = DispatchQueue(label: "WD")

WDFruits.async {
    print("custom start!=============")

    for i in 1...5 {
        print("🍑"+" \(i)ea")

    }
    print("custom   end!=============")

}

WDFruits.async {
    print("custom start!=============")

    for i in 1...5 {
        print("🍊"+" \(i)ea")

    }
    print("custom   end!=============")

}

for i in 1...5 {
    print("🍎"+" \(i)ea")
}

```
Async makes do custom task parallely, and Serial makes serperate between custom queue and main task.



```
custom start!=============
🍑 1ea
🍎 1ea
🍎 2ea
🍑 2ea
🍎 3ea
🍑 3ea
🍎 4ea
🍎 5ea
🍑 4ea
🍑 5ea
custom   end!=============
custom start!=============
🍊 1ea
🍊 2ea
🍊 3ea
🍊 4ea
🍊 5ea
custom   end!=============
```
