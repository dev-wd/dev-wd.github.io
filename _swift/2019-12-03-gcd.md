In Swift, Grand Central Dispatch API (GCD) sopports thread programming.

Just using GCD is not difficult, but there are many preceding concepts to understand.

## Serial vs Concurrent Queue.

iOS supports either serial queue and concurrent queue GCD. 

Serial queue is FIFO(First In, First Out), which usually called as queue in data structure concepts.

### But then, what is concurrent queue?

Before knowing concurrent queue, we need to know 'concurrent' first.

It is easy to mistake that Concurrent is Parallelism.

When we do multi- threading, we can see threads are running parallely.

System memory resource is limitied and should be occupied by a thread, OS needs to switch thread which occupying OS memory resource continously. we call this situation as Concurrency.

Therefore, Relationship between parallelism and concurrency is like below.

- Parallelism requires concurrency, but concurrency does not guarantee parallelism.


## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
sync 는 분기된 쓰레드 작업다 끝나길 기다리고 리턴도 받는거
async는 분기된 쓰레드 작업 다 끝나길 기다리지 않고 바뀌면 알아서 바뀐다.

---------
개념은 여기까지면 된거 같고...
여기서 부터 사실 진짜 GCD 
GCD는 main global coustom이 있다.
걔네를 코드와 함꼐 설명해주겠당
